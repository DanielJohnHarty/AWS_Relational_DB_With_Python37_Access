# So let's add a user
# The following SQL insert query format may look a bit strange but it's a secure way to insert data into a database.
sql = "INSERT INTO `users` (`email`, `password`) VALUES (%s, %s)"
cur.execute(sql, ('testingtesting@boing.org', 'so-super-secret'))  
# This format of inserting secures against something called 'SQL injection'. Google it for more details - it's very clever engineering!
           
# The insert has been made but we haven't committed the changes yet. So let's do it:
con.commit()

# And finally, let's double check that our insert query worked by performing a SELECT query
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

# When you use a SELECT query to retrieve data from a database, they are stored within your cursor object.
# You can retrive them one at a time, all at once or in specific quantities. As we only have a small numebr of records, we can can go ahead and 'fetchall' of them:
cur.fetchall()

# And voila! If you can see user dat appear in your PYthon interpreter, you have sucessfully connected to your database, created a table, inserted into it and then retrieved from it. All from a remote Python interpreter.
