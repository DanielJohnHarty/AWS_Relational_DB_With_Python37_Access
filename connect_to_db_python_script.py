# The insert has been made but we haven't committed the changes yet. So let's do it:
con.commit()

# And finally, let's double check that our insert query worked by performing a SELECT query
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

# When you use a SELECT query to retrieve data from a database, they are stored within your cursor object.
# You can retrive them one at a time, all at once or in specific quantities. As we only have a small number of records, we can can go ahead and 'fetchall' of them:
cur.fetchall()
